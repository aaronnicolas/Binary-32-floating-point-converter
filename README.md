# Running the Program
This guide provides instructions on how to run a Python file either using the command line (CMD).

## Running Python Files on CMD

Download the source code folder in this repository.

1. **Open Command Prompt:**
    - Press `Win + R` to open the Run dialog.
    - Type `cmd` and press Enter to open Command Prompt.

2. **Navigate to Python File Directory:**
    - Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory containing the project's python file.
    - For example:
        ```
        cd path\to\your\python\file
        ```

3. **Run Python File:**
    - Once in the directory, run the Python file by typing:
        ```
        python Binary-32_Floating_Point_Converter.py
        ```

4. **View GUI Application:**
    - The GUI application will launch, displaying the graphical interface of the Menu. Upon displaying the menu, users are presented with two buttons: "Binary Floating Point to IEEE-754/1985" or "Decimal Floating Point to IEEE-754/1985".
    - Upon selecting a conversion option, users will be redirected to the respective converter interface, where they will be prompted to input the necessary values.
    - After inputting the required values, users can press the "Convert" button to see the results. Optionally, they may choose to click the "Output to Text File" button, which will generate a text file containing their input and the results. A pop-up window will display the name of the text file, which can be found within the same folder/directory as the code.
    - Furthermore, a "Back to Menu" button is available, allowing users to return to the main menu where they can choose another converter.
